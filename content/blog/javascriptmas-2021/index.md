The JavaScriptmas challenge is what started it all!

December 1: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/coa0745819274e27680de0c0d>  
I'm glad I clicked early because the submission time is midnight GMT! Even though I have gained a vast amount of experience since last year, I was still afraid to get started. Until I did - then it was like "Hey, great! A nice easy warm-up!" I was able to run through the _brute force-more elegant_ cycle really quickly and get the solution working. Day 1 done!

December 2: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/coad94b89bad0a3d7107383f9>  
I listened to the introduction before running upstairs to rescue my burning cast iron frying pan (Oops! Forgot I turned on the stove!). While running, I realized the solution to this challenge was adding an event listener, something I had to Google and struggled with last year, but this year could write up quickly without even thinking of any of the syntax too hard. I may sweep back to pick up the challenge portion but at this point, I have a quick working solution.

I ran into some trouble starting this one - I needed to back out and logically think through where I was putting things into the code. I kept it really basic but I got it completed. It was similar to December 2, in that the challenge was to update an existing page with new information, so I grabbed a few emoji to jazz up my work.

The challenge today was to create a checklist from an array of items. I had my inital moment of "hey, how do I do this?" before I was able to knock out the basic challenge. I would normally try to complete the stretch goals on a weekend, but my rehearsal went long today and I have a commitment tonight. Perhaps tomorrow I can give them all a try!
