The JavaScriptmas challenge is what started it all!

December 1: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/coa0745819274e27680de0c0d>  
I'm glad I clicked early because the submission time is midnight GMT! Even though I have gained a vast amount of experience since last year, I was still afraid to get started. Until I did - then it was like "Hey, great! A nice easy warm-up!" I was able to run through the _brute force-more elegant_ cycle really quickly and get the solution working. Day 1 done!
