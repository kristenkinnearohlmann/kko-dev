The JavaScriptmas challenge is what started it all! In 2020, I took a chance with my elementary JS knowledge to tackle the Scrimba 202 JavaScriptmas challenges, even though I had not yet started that learning path in my Flatiron program. Although I had to do quite a lot of Google searches to complete those challenges, I remember learning a lot and feeling more capable than I had imaged I would.

I'm excited to participate in this year's challenges! With my Flatiron program complete, I am enjoying the ability to knock the initial challenges out quickly while expecting to be challenged along the way. I will continue to add daily to this blog until all 24 days are complete.

December 1: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/coa0745819274e27680de0c0d>  
I'm glad I clicked early because the submission time is midnight GMT! Even though I have gained a vast amount of experience since last year, I was still afraid to get started. Until I did - then it was like "Hey, great! A nice easy warm-up!" I was able to run through the _brute force-more elegant_ cycle really quickly and get the solution working. Day 1 done!

I listened to the introduction before running upstairs to rescue my burning cast iron frying pan (Oops! Forgot I turned on the stove!). While running, I realized the solution to this challenge was adding an event listener, something I had to Google and struggled with last year, but this year could write up quickly without even thinking of any of the syntax too hard. I may sweep back to pick up the challenge portion but at this point, I have a quick working solution.

I ran into some trouble starting this one - I needed to back out and logically think through where I was putting things into the code. I kept it really basic but I got it completed. It was similar to December 2, in that the challenge was to update an existing page with new information, so I grabbed a few emoji to jazz up my work.

December 4: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co84f459c95515b0102050ae2>  
The challenge today was to create a checklist from an array of items. I had my initial moment of "hey, how do I do this?" before I was able to knock out the basic challenge. I would normally try to complete the stretch goals on a weekend, but my rehearsal went long today and I have a commitment tonight. Perhaps tomorrow I can give them all a try!

December 5: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/coe4c492f82ca2bcd19f2e8ed>  
I missed posting before midnight GMT because I didn't get the challenge done before church and I had an evening concert. I went ahead and completed it to ensure I get all days done! This was a nice little refreshed on how to perform getting a random number.

December 6: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/coce2435b83039c210a34a9c7>  
The instructions were a little unclear but I think I did what was expected. It may have been because it was more straightforward than I expected? The hint asked you to use toggle on classlist, so I included that. I know the button on the text is changing appropriately so I called this good.

December 7: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co0a14661a0a96793e3f5fc25>  
I was initially apprehensive about this challenge because I know almost nothing about using audio on sites, other than learning knowledge. Googling helped a lot with this one! It was quite gratifying to be able to get the basic challenge working!

December 8: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co38b44da8fb9993b6a7edf39>  
I had to run in the middle of the day when the local field with the dome up had the track available, so I missed submitting by midnight GMT. It was fun to see the same solution from yesterday to play audio reproduced in today's challenge so I could build on it! I knew that the solution would involve a CSS transform, something I need to continue to study, so it was great to have some practice!

December 9: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co71d43a7bae12ff3f3cba89b>  
I'm enjoying these easier challenges because I know the harder ones are coming! I left my decorations pretty plain and solved just the basic challenge. This is another example where I will return to the challenge later to work on the stretch goals since they apply to projects I have in development.

December 10: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co3ca4b54a7a3b0663b633481>  
I was not aware of the `meter` HTML element so this was fun! I hard-coded my Christmas day because even though I could see the date was set correctly when I created a variable, getting the day value for it gave me 24 instead of 25? Something to look into later!

December 11: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co7ca4f33ab0b9f6d6d1440c9>  
I love image carousels! I remember working on the one for JavaScriptmas 2020 and feeling like things were finally clicking for me, so it was fun to revisit that moment.

December 12: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co3364b879d5c8378f9a7c4f0>  
I had to solve this one 3 times - my computer crashed, then I had to log back into Scrimba! I love adding items to lists with JS, so this one was fast and easy. I should probably start doing the challenge items too!

December 13: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co0f64e7b92900de261c5d7cc>  
This one took longer than expected! I appreciated a vegetarian option in the food to be served.

December 14: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co6cc42c3a260dac960696e99>  
I was able to solve duplicating the elf in about 2 minutes - new record! Since I'm on Day 2 of a workshop in-person with Frontend Masters, I decided not to tackle any of the additional challenges yet.

December 15: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co8b945128fbf0908dd9eddeb>  
I was able to get my greeting switched pretty quick! I'll have to go back and add more greetings.

December 16: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/cof934de29e2312656127a527>  
My solution to retrieve a movie based on age and genre had just one thing I think I could change but I left the working solution as is.

December 17: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co4d34da68ae8afe9b6c0b322>  
I had fun sorting people into naughty and nice lists!

December 18: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co30b4b35b4620a4b4a0db658>  
This was the first challenge that really stumped me. I wasn't clear on the explanation, and the hint didn't help me much more. I got a solution working but it's pretty ugly. It reminded me that periodic studying of CSS is a helpful thing, so I need to add it back to my study list!

December 19: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co9664c42b38f59b88d1e5ea2>  
I was momentarily stumped on how to implement `async` and `await`, since I wanted to take that approach rather than the intermediate `fetch...then` pattern. Once I re-wrote the code a second time to working state, I was able to finish off the challenge.

December 20: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/cod594aa5a1e49d0525051638>  
It took me a while to determine how to invoke the color changing on the snowman items, and my solution is hacky but it works. I'm still not sure what to do with the `input` variable that was given, so I'll have to watch the solution tomorrow to see what I could have done differently.

December 21: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/co7cd418fadd00916fc7adc8c>  
It took me a good amount of time to solve the speed calculation. I decided to add a button to perform the calculation instead of trying to figure out which of the events I wanted to trap.

December 22: <https://scrimba.com/scrim/coa294e70ad0d0a6a34fc5f3e>  
Something kept crashing my browser while I tried to solve this challenge, so I coded it outside Scrimba then pasted it back in. I still had to look up `setInterval()` to use it properly! This did provide me with some practice for a countdown timer I was going to build, so I was glad to have this experience!
