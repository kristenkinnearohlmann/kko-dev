I'm excited about publishing this blog!  

For several years, I have wanted to publish information on the problems I have solved. I found that many of the solutions I created were cobbled together from various Stack Overflow and official documentation, or contained a key piece of information that took pages of Google searches to find. I thought that if I wrote up my solutions as well, it could juice the search results for other that are looking to solve the same problem!

Another goal is to learn more by writing out my thought process, detailing solutions, and taking the time to think things through from another perspective.
